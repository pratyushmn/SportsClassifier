# SportsClassifier
A machine learning model that can identify the sport being played from a picture of that sport. 

Uses fastai libraries, and Jupyter Notebooks which were created and edited on Google's Colaboratory platform.

I wasn't able to upload the actual model itself (resnet50main.pkl) so here's a link to the file on another website: https://gofile.io/?c=FNbAva
